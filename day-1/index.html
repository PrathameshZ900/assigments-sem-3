<h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
<p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>

<h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
<p>The periodic table is a <span style="color: yellow;">tabular arrangement</span> of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are
    classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>

<h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
<p>Chemical reactions are represented using chemical equations. Here's an example of a chemical reaction: <br>
   <b> 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O </b><br>
    This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas <b>(H₂)</b> and oxygen gas <b>(0₂)</b> to form water <b>(H₂O)</b></p>

<h4>Important Concepts</h4>
<p><b>Stoichiometry</b> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
   <dfn>superscripts</dfn> indicate the <sub>number</sub> of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our
    lives.</p>
